				<h3>Javascript Basics</h3>
				<p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scription language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Variable Declaration</u> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></li>
					<li><u>Variable Assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span></li>
					<li><u>Data Type Date</u> types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span>, aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
					<li><u>Conditionals</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  These are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in your code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
					<li><u>Loops</u> There are many different kids of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
					<li><u>Function</u> Functions are an encapsulation of code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from IKEA, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top ; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
